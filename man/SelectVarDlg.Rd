\title{Select Elements of a Set by Click}

\description{\code{SelectVarDlg()} is a GUI utility, which brings up a dialog and lets the user select elements (either variables of a data.frame or
levels of a factor) by point and click in a listbox. The list of selected items is written to the clipboard so
that the code can afterwards easily be pasted in the source file.\cr
This function is best used together with the package \code{DescToolsAddIns}, with which the functions can be assigned to a keystroke in RStudio.%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
SelectVarDlg(x, ...)

\method{SelectVarDlg}{default}(x, useIndex = FALSE, ...)

\method{SelectVarDlg}{factor}(x, ...)

\method{SelectVarDlg}{data.frame}(x, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{the object containing the elements to be selected. x can be a data.frame, a factor or any other vector.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{useIndex}{defines, if the enquoted variablenames (default) or the index values should be returned.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{\dots}{further arguments to be passed to the default function. }
}

\details{
When working with big data.frames with many variables it is often tedious to build subsets by typing the
columnnames. Here is where the function comes in offering a "point and click" approach for selecting the interesting
columns.
When x is a \code{data.frame} the columnnames are listed,
when x is a factor the according levels are listed and in all other cases the list is filled with the unique elements of x.
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~

}
\value{
A comma separated list with the selected values enquoted is returned invisibly as well as
written to clipboard for easy inserting the text in an editor afterwards.
